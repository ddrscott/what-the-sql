# Introduction

SQL is an acronym for Structured Query Language. Old timers will pronounce it as
"sequel" and can wield it a precision surgical tool able to pint point a
cancerous data anomaly on their first try [after 5 other tries].

The purpose of this book is to transform the reader, from this point forward
referred to as "you", into a lean mean SQL thinking machine. By the end of the
book, you'll think of all data in terms on neat rows and columns. That recipe
book your grandma keeps around aught to be 3 delicious tables. The team stats
for Timmy's T-ball league can be 5 tables of play by play wonderments. You'll
get so good at tabular data manipulation a trip to the stalls can lead to the
best data dump of your life!
